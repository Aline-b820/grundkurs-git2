## Exercise: Branch Out with GitHub Branches! ðŸŒ²

**Objective**: Delve into one of Git's most powerful features: branching. By the end of this exercise, you'll have created, navigated, and understood the essence of branches in GitHub, setting a solid foundation for parallel development and experimentation without disrupting the main codebase.

### Instructions:

1. **Understanding Branches**: Before making one, it's crucial to grasp the concept. A branch in Git is essentially a unique set of code changes with a unique name. It represents an independent line of development, allowing you to work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously without them affecting each other.

2. **Switch Between Branches**:
   - Find the drop-down menu labeled "main".
   - Click on it and select "exercise 1"
   - Notice how the codebase changes as you switch between them.
